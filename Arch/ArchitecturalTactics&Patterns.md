# Architectural Tactics & Patterns

​	Architectural pattern is discovered, not invented. Architectural patterns spontaneously emerge in reaction to environmental conditions. 

​	Tactics is simple, for single architectural force, while patterns combine multiple design decisions. Tactics are atoms and patterns are molecules. 	

##### pre -questions:

* relationships between patterns and tactics?

* how patterns is constructed from tactics? 

* how tactics can be used to tailor patterns?

## Architectural Patterns(definition)

relationship between:

* #### A context

* #### A problem

  arise in the given context

  the pattern should describe the problem, including the Quality Attributes that must be met.

* #### A solution

  * abstracted
  * the structure to solve the problem, maybe by: static relationships among elements, runtime behavior for and interaction between elements.
  * described by: element types, interaction mechanisms or connectors, toological layout of the components, semantic constraints
